VaR & ES Forecasting using Deep Learning

By Indu Sai Atla

1. Project Overview
   
Objective: Implement a novel framework for forecasting Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected
Shortfall (ES) using:


• Mogrifier RNNs with Quantile Regression (QRMogRNN)


• GAN-based scenario generation for tail risk modeling

Key Innovations:

• Hybrid approach combining decomposition techniques with deep learning

• Joint modeling of market heterogeneity properties

• First implementation of GANs for ES estimation in financial risk
